form so that I can add their information to the system."

The user must fill out all fields: name, address, phone, email, and aircraft ID.

On clicking the "Add Passenger" button:
A valid passenger is sent to the backend via an API call 
(POST request to /addNewPassenger).

so that I can see the details of passengers in the system."

When the page is loaded,
Then a request is made to fetch the list of passengers from the server.

Given the passengers have been fetched successfully,
When the data is returned,
Then the list of passengers is displayed on the page with their names, addresses, phone numbers, and emails.

Given there are passengers in the system,
When the data is rendered,
Then the user can see each passengerâ€™s details (name, address, phone, and email).

 from the system so that I can manage the passenger list."

The user should see a list of passengers with a "Delete" button next to each passenger.
Clicking the "Delete" button will trigger an API call 
(DELETE request to /deletePassengerById/{passengerID}).

Upon successful deletion:
The passenger is removed from the displayed list.
The list is updated to reflect the deletion.
